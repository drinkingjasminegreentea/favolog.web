      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help people discover the best products in the market
        through the word of mouth. You find a great product that you think
        everyone should check out. Great! Add to your catalog to share with your
        followers. We also want to give each person a chance to introduce
        themselves to their own network of friends, family and followers from
        another angle by sharing their own unique favorites and preferences. For
        example, you really can tell a lot about person's lifestyle and fashion
        taste based on what type of a clothing item she or he prefers. And
        lastly, we want to serve small businesses that make great products, but
        are unable to afford advertisement on major platforms such as Google or
        Facebook to achieve a full market reach. We think this will be a great
        platform for people like yourself to spread the word about them. We hope
        that we will be able to bring the most value to you and your community
        and make your lives easier.

      <h3>How does favolog work?</h3>
      <p>
        You have favorite pair of jeans or a t-shirt you think everyone should
        check out. Great! The easiest way to add it to your profile is by using
        a link to the item on the internet. The system will automatically
        extract the proper title, as well as the image of the item with the
        source information. You can also add it manually by entering the
        information manually instead of using a link.
