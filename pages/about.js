      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help people discover the best products in the market
        through the word of mouth. We also want to give each person a chance to
        introduce themselves to their own network of friends and family by
        displaying their own unique favorites and preferences. And lastly, we
        want to serve small businesses that make great products but have no
        money to buy advertisement. We think this will be a great platform for
        people like you to spread the good word about them. We hope you get the
        best use out of using our free service.

      <h3>How does favolog work?</h3>
      <p>
        You have favorite pair of jeans or a t-shirt you think everyone should
        check out. Great! The easiest way to add it to your profile is by using
        a link to the item on the internet. The system will automatically
        extract the proper title of the item, as well as the image with the
        source information. You can also add it manually by entering the title
        and the image instead of the link.
