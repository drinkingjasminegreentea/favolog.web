        opinion you trust and value. Please use it to best serve yourself and
        your network.

      <h3>How does favolog work?</h3>
      <p>
        You can add any of your favorite items - products, books or movies into
        your own catalogs to share with your followers. You can explore
        favorites shared by your network and see if there's anything new that
        you'll love!
