      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>
        Our mission is to help people discover the best products in the market
        through the word of mouth. We also want to give each person a chance to
        introduce themselves to their own network of friends, family and
        followers by displaying their own unique favorites and preferences. And
        lastly, we want to serve small businesses that make great products, but
        are unable to afford advertisement. We think this will be a great
        platform for people like you to spread the good word about such
        businesses. We hope that you can get the best use and value from using
        our service.

      <h3>How does favolog work?</h3>
      <p>
        You have favorite pair of jeans or a t-shirt you think everyone should
        check out. Great! The easiest way to add it to your profile is by using
        a link to the item on the internet. The system will automatically
        extract the proper title, as well as the image of the item with the
        source information. You can also add it manually by entering the
        information manually instead of using a link.
